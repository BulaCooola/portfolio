        Welcome to my portfolio! I am a 4/4 at Stevens Institute of Technology studying Computer
        Science. I have a strong passion to making web applications and have a background in both
        front-end and back-end development. I am currently looking for any internship opportunities
        to leverage the skills I've acquired during my studies. In addition, I am an NCAA DIII
        wrestler at
        <a href="https://stevensducks.com/">Stevens Athletics</a>, and I have a strong passions for
        photography, surfing, traveling, and some video games.
